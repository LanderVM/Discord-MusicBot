## üìù | Tutorial: Setting Up Your Discord Music Bot

### üìñ | Introduction

I created this tutorial because the original one wasn't very straightforward for beginners. This guide will help you set up your own Discord music bot using Lavalink and Discord.js. The bot is capable of playing music in voice channels and supports various commands for controlling music playback. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üöÄ Very Quick Setup (Windows Only)

> **Note:** Use the [‚ö°Quick Setup](#quick-setup) below if you plan to run the bot 24/7 or want to set it up correctly.

1. [‚¨áÔ∏è Download this project](https://github.com/LanderVM/Discord-MusicBot/archive/refs/heads/v5.zip), right-click it and unzip it.
2. Then [‚¨áÔ∏è Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and start Docker Desktop.
3. When Docker Desktop is running, open the unzipped file you just downloaded and run the `QuickStart.bat` file. This will do almost everything for you.

The project will ask you for some Discord information.

- **Discord Bot Token:**

  1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  2. Click on **New Application**.
  3. Name your application, agree to the TOS and Developer Policy, then click **Create**.
  4. Navigate to the **Bot** tab and click **Reset Token**, then **Yes, do it!**.
  5. Click **Copy** to copy the token and keep it safe. **Do not share this token with anyone!**

- **Discord Client ID:**

  - Again on the Discord Developer Portal webpage, click on **OAuth2** on the left side of the website, and copy your Client ID.

- **Discord Client Secret:**
  - On the same webpage, click **Reset Client Secret** and copy it.

If you gave in incorrect information, open the `Discord-MusicBot-v4` folder and delete the `.env` file.

    chmod +x start.sh
    ```

1. Ensure all optional settings are updated in the `Discord-MusicBot-v4/config.js` file.
2. Go into the `Discord-MusicBot-v4` folder and build and start both the bot and Lavalink using this command:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

   _(Optional)_ Check the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker/application.yml` files if you changed any optional settings in the `.env` file.

### üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Bot Not Appearing Online:** Check if the bot token is correct and if the bot has been invited to the server.
